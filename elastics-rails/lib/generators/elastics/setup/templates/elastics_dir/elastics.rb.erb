# inspect the methods loaded in this module and their usage
# in the rails console by just typing:
# >> puts <%= @module_name %>.elastics.doc
# you can eventually restrict the doc to a single method by pasing its name:
# >> puts <%= @module_name %>.elastics.doc :search
# see the detailed doc for this feature at http://elastics.github.io/elastics/doc/2-elastics/4-Self-Documentation.html

module <%= @module_name %>

  extend self

  # if you don't use elastics scopes and you stick with elastics templates, you can comment the next line
  include Elastics::Scopes

  # enables the templating
  include Elastics::Templates
  # loads the <%= "#{@module_name.underscore}.yml" %> file
  elastics.load_search_source

  # you may need to add more method here, usually custom scopes
  # or wrapper methods that use one of the autogenerated methods from the loaded templates

end
